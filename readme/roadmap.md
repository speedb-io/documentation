# Roadmap

The [product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/speedb-io/projects/4/views/1) provides a snapshot of the features we are currently developing, what we are planning for the future, and the items that have already been delivered.

We have added a column with items that are awaiting community feedback. We invite you to participate in our polls inside, share your thoughts about topics that are important to you, and let us know if there is anything else you would like to see on the list.
