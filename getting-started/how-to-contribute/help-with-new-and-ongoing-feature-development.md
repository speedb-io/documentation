# Help with new and ongoing feature development

If you find a feature request that you'd like to work on, and there's a pull request open for it, you can help by testing it and providing feedback. When giving feedback, please keep comments positive and constructive.

### How to check out a pull request

Every pull request has its own number, which  is visible both in the URL\
of a pull request page as well as in the title of the pull request page itself\
(the format is **#123**, where 123 is the PR number).&#x20;

To check out a pull request locally, [follow this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally).&#x20;

If you're using GitHub CLI, be sure to choose the **GitHub CLI** option rather than **Web Browser** on the guide page. Once you have the pull request changes checked out locally, you can move on to\
[testing the changes](contribute-code.md#unit-tests).
