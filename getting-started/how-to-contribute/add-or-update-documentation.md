# Add or update documentation

We strive to offer extensive and up-to-date documentation for Speedb, so if you find an area with missing or incomplete documentation, feel free to contribute.

All documentation is written for clarity and readability. Beyond fixing spelling and grammar, this also means that content is worded to be accessible to a broad audience.

Typos or other minor fixes that don't change the meaning of a document don't need a formal review, and can be handled directly as a pull request.
