# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Speedb! There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate them all.

## Ways to contribute

There are several ways to contribute to Speedb:

* [Contribute code](contribute-code.md)
* [Feature request process](feature-request-process.md)
* [Submit a Pull Request](submit-a-pull-request.md)
* [Add or update documentation](add-or-update-documentation.md)
* [Report bugs and other issues](report-bugs-and-other-issues.md)
* [Help with new and ongoing feature development](help-with-new-and-ongoing-feature-development.md)
* [Check out a Pull Request](broken-reference) ****&#x20;

All documents and pull requests must be consistent with the guidelines and follow the Speedb documentation and coding styles.

For both documentation and code:

* Once the Speedb team accepts new documentation or features, we're responsible for the maintenance of said changes.  This means we'll weigh the benefit of each contribution against the cost of maintaining it.
* The appropriate style must be applied
* The license must be present in all contributions
* Code review is used to improve the correctness, clarity, and consistency of all contributions
