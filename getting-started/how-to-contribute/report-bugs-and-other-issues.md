# Report bugs and other issues

Like all software systems, weâ€™ll inevitably experience bugs or other types of issues.

You can help by reporting bugs or issues with detailed information (ideally with a test case attached), or even simply analyzing and reproducing an existing issue, is a great way to get involved.

We track bugs and other kinds of issues using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/speedb-io/speedb/issues).
