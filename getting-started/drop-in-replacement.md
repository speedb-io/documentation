# Drop-in Replacement

#### Replace your existing Rocksdb with Speedb

1. [Download the package](https://github.com/speedb-io/speedb/releases)
2. Copy the library along with the include folder to your project
3. Link it

That's it - you can now start using using Speedb!

Note: Speedb is fully compatible with Rocksdb. The changes can be reverted at any time, although we'd appreciate your feedback if, for any reason, you choose to revert.
